      Meet FIFO - we only have room for two animals so her name is our rule - one
      way or another. She's exceptionally sweet but maybe too clingy? It's kind

      Meet Fresh Meat - We didn't pick the name, but that's generally 
      saved for the newest arrival to our wonderful home. We have high hopes
      for this strange looking cat. Place your bets now!
