        Meet FIFO - we only have room for two animals so her name is our rule - one
        way or another. She's exceptionally sweet but maybe too clingy? It's kind
        of weird no one has adopted her yet. Oh well. Guess we shouldn't get our hopes
        up.

        This is Not Yet - something we hope they won't have to say for long!
        They got their name after their third loss in the underground fighting ring
        we voluntell our residents to participate in. Maybe she's the right choice for you!
        After all, she still is wearing her mask despite being vaccinated. That's more 
        consideration than her opponents showed her in the ring!
